# ESG-Score-and-Financial-Strcuture
This project has been developed for my Master's Thesis. My idea here was to understand whether being sustainable for a company could lead to a better financial structure. In particular I assessed what is the impact of ESG Score on the Financial Perrformance (ROA) and Financial Risk (Credit Risk) of the most important firms in Ialy performing a Panel Data Analysis Regression.

The database has been created exclusively by me, downloading data from Refinitiv database, provided by Thompson Reuters. Using university services for having the access to this data provider, I couldn't just download a database, but I had to download specific financial documents and data, and subsequently create my own database from the scratch on Excel. This and the type of analysis performed on the data, didn't allow me to automate perfectly the code, reason why it looks pretty naive, since I had to repeat the same analysis for every company.
