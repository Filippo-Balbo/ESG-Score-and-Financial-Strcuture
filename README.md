# ESG-Score-and-Financial-Strcuture
This project has been developed for my Master's Thesis. My idea here was to understand whether being sustainable for a company could lead to a better financial structure. In particular I assessed what is the impact of ESG Score on the Financial Perrformance (ROA) and Financial Risk (Credit Risk) of the most important firms in Ialy.
