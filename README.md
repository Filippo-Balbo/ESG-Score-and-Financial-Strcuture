# ESG-Score-and-Financial-Strcuture
This project has been developed for my Master's Thesis. My idea here was to understand whether being sustainable for a company could lead to a better financial structure. In particular I assessed which is the impact of ESG Score on the Financial Performance (ROA) and Financial Risk (Credit Risk) of the main firms in Ialy, performing a Panel Data Analysis Regression.

The database has been created exclusively by me, downloading data from Refinitiv database, provided by Thompson Reuters. Using university services for having the access to this data provider, I couldn't just download a database, but I had to deal with several specific financial documents and data, and subsequently create my own database from the scratch using Excel. This source issue and the type of analysis performed on the data, didn't allow me to automate perfectly the code, reason why it looks pretty naive, since I had to repeat the same analysis for every company.
